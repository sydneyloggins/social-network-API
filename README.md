# NoSQL: Social Network API

## Description

This project uses insomnia to create a social network API. The user can create a new user with an email and id, add friends, and create thoughts/reactions to posts. This back-end implements Express and Mongoose for the database.
I built this project to learn and understand how to use MongoDB and how to implement the database with an API. 

## Installation

Run npm start in the terminal to run localhost:3000
